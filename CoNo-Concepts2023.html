<h2>Workshop "Computational Notebooks for FCA" (CoNo-Concepts 2023)<br> (at 
<a href="https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/icfca2023/">ICFCA'2023</a>)</h2>

<p>Organiser: <a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk">Uta Priss</a></p>

<p>Notebooks, in particular Jupyter Notebooks, are becoming increasingly popular
as a means for documenting procedures, data, calculations, and findings
for data science applications and teaching. It has been speculated
that computational notebooks might replace traditional scientific papers,
as they present data and results in an interactive manner which
readers can execute while they are reading. As a method for data analysis,
FCA could utilise notebooks for directly publishing and sharing
data exploration workflows, algorithms and interactive teaching materials.
Notebooks even present a uniform interface for a variety of programming
languages potentially allowing for code integration across languages. This
workshop intends to provide a space for FCA researchers who are already
using notebooks to share their experiences and for others to learn about
them. </p>

<p>Researchers who would like to present their FCA experiences with notebooks
at the workshop are asked to prepare a notebook which can be executed
and presented (instead of slides) and send the link to it to 
<img src = "https://www.upriss.org.uk/emadr.gif"> by the
submission deadline. The length of the notebook should correspond to
a 20 minute presentation. Ideally the linked notebook should be directly
executable without requiring further installation (i.e. through one of
the cloud hosting sites for notebooks). Alternatively, a link to a static,
downloadable version of the notebook is also acceptable. The proceedings of
the workshop will not be printed but instead consist of a website with
links to the notebooks. The main criterion for acceptance is that
the notebook must demonstrate an application of FCA.
