<h2>Workshop "Computational Notebooks for FCA" (CoNo-Concepts 2023)<br> (at 
<a href="https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/icfca2023/">ICFCA'2023</a>)</h2>

<p>Organiser: <a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk">Uta Priss</a></p>

<p>Notebooks, in particular Jupyter Notebooks, are becoming increasingly popular
as a means for documenting procedures, data, calculations, and findings
for data science applications and teaching. It has been speculated
that computational notebooks might replace traditional scientific papers,
as they present data and results in an interactive manner which
readers can execute while they are reading. As a method for data analysis,
FCA could utilise notebooks for directly publishing and sharing
data exploration workflows, algorithms and interactive teaching materials.
Notebooks even present a uniform interface for a variety of programming
languages potentially allowing for code integration across languages. This
workshop intends to provide a space for FCA researchers who are already
using notebooks to share their experiences and for others to learn about
them. The workshop will start with a short introduction into the topic,
followed by contributed presentations and end with a panel discussion
on future opportunities for computational notebooks for FCA.</p>

<p>Researchers who would like to present their FCA experiences with notebooks
at the workshop are asked to prepare a notebook containing their presentation
(instead of slides) and send the link to it to 
<img src = "https://www.upriss.org.uk/emadr.gif"> by the
submission deadline. The length of the notebook should correspond to
a 20 minute presentation. Ideally the linked notebook should be directly
executable without requiring further installation (i.e. through one of
the cloud hosting sites for notebooks). Alternatively, a link to a static,
downloadable version of the notebook is also acceptable. The proceedings of
the workshop will not be printed but instead consist of a website with
links to the notebooks. The main criterion for acceptance is that
the notebook must demonstrate an application of FCA. The website with the
links to the notebooks will be sent to all participants after the submission
deadline. In the unlikely event that too many notebooks are submitted, the
participants will be asked to vote which ones they are most interested
in seeing actively presented at the workshop. The other notebooks will
stay on the website but not be actively presented.</p>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>

<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: May 1, 2023 (by sending the link to the notebook to 
<img src = "https://www.upriss.org.uk/emadr.gif">)
<li>Website with notebook links sent to participants: May 15
<li>Voting period in case of too many submissions: May 15-31
<li>Schedule of presentations decided: June 2
</ul>

(Researchers who are interested in participating, do not want to
present but might want to vote on the selection of the notebooks
should also send an email to <img src = "https://www.upriss.org.uk/emadr.gif"> by May 1.)
